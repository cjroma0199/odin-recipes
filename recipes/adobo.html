    <img src="../images/Adobo.jpg" alt="Pork Adobo">
    <p>Philippine adobo is a Spanish-influenced meat dish consisting of a tangy sauce of vinegar, garlic, soy sauce and black pepper. Vinegar is a common ingredient found in many Filipino dishes and it’s one of the main ingredients in any adobo. Some may regard Adobo to be the national dish of the Philippines because it is so popular. There are so many different versions of this dish around as people have adapted this dish to their own taste.  One such variant is a more modern take that does not use soy sauce (adobong puti or white adobo).
